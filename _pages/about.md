Welcome to the Kari Genomics Lab website!

We are a computer science and bioinformatics research group at the Universityt of Waterloo. We study theoretical aspects of [genomic signatures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genomic_signature) as well as their applications in comparative genomics. We also study [DNA barcodes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_barcoding) as part of the [BIOSCAN](https://ibol.org/bioscan/) project. For more information about specific projects, please visit our [github page](https://github.com/Kari-Genomics-Lab/). You can also visit Dr. Kari's [personal website](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~lila/) for more information.
